## Front end

The front-end code was build using Flask. To run it, you should configure your database first (steps to configure it, will be added later).

After, you need to install some dependencies:
```bash
$ pip3 install flask python-dotenv json2html
```

After, in the `./src` folder you can run `flask run`, and a local server will be started at `localhost:5000`
